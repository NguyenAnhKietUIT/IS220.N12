    <h2 class="mt-4">2 treks for discovering Vietnam’s rural heartlands</h2>

    <p>
        Jungle-cloaked hills that once shook with the sound of combat are now the serene setting for adventurous hikes
        to remote villages, lofty lookouts, tumbling waterfalls and the summit of Indochina’s highest mountain.
        With plenty of local guides and trekking agencies on hand to help you to the top of the trails, all you really need
        to do is pick a route – and set out.

        Many of Vietnam’s top hikes are best attempted with local support. The tropical terrain can be challenging,
        the weather can be unpredictable and you’ll need someone who speaks the local languages to make arrangements for meals
        and accommodation in hill-tribe communities. If you combine a trek with a village homestay – which we heartily recommend –
        it’s possible to escape the crowds and find the hospitality and captivating culture that first put Vietnam on the travel map.

        With its towering topography, the mountainous north of the country offers the best trekking opportunities,
        but there are routes all over the country, from the Chinese border to the lowland jungles near Ho Chi Minh City.
        Here’s our pick of the top treks in Vietnam.
